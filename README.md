PyCity Schools Analysis

In summary we looked at a total of 15 schools and 39170 students which had a total budget of $24,649,428.00. The average math score was 78.985371 and 74.980853% of all students passed. The average reading score was 81.87784 and 85.805463% of all students passed. The percentage of students who passed both math and reading across all schools was 65.172326%.

From this data we can observe/conclude a few different things. Firstly, schools when sorted by type have a major difference in overall passing/failing rate. Schools that are of the type charter have a much higher overall percentage of students who pass when compared to that of district schools. All 5 schools in the top Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) belong to the charter type. Whereas all 5 schools in the Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) belong to the district type. We can further support this conclusion when looking at the scores by school type. In charter schools the average math score is 83.473852 and the passing percentage is 93.620830%. In charter schools the average reading score is 83.896421 and the passing percentage is 96.586489%. The overall amount of students in charter schools who pass both math and reading is 90.432244%. In district schools however the average math score is 76.956733 and the passing percentage is 66.548453%. In district schools the average reading score is 80.966636 and the passing percentage was 80.799062%. The overall amount of students in disrict schools who pass both math and reading is 53.672208%.

Secondly, we can conclude that the higher the number of students in the school the lower the averages/percentages get. schools of small and medium size have very similar succes rates in terms of passing as well as very similar average scores.
Average Math Score Small/Medium: 83.821598/83.374684 compared to Average Math Score Large: 77.746417 
Average Reading Score Small/Medium: 83.929843/83.864438 compared to Average Reading Score Large: 81.344493 
Percent Passing Math Small/Medium: 93.550225%/93.599695% compared to Percent Passing Math Large: 69.963361% 
Percent Passing Reading Small/Medium: 96.099437%/96.790680% compared to Percent Passing Reading Large: 82.766634% 
Percent Overall Passing Small/Medium: 89.883853%/90.621535% compared to Percent Overall Passing Large: 58.286003%

Lastly, we can conclude that the lower the Spending Range(Per Student) the more likely that student is to be successful.
Overall percentage of people who passed math/reading <585: 90.369459% 
Overall percentage of people who passed math/reading 585-630: 81.418596% 
Overall percentage of people who passed math/reading 630-645: 62.857656% 
Overall percentage of people who passed math/reading 645-680: 53.526855% 
As you can see there is a clear correlation between spending range and student success, The lower the spending range the higher the percentage of people who passed.
